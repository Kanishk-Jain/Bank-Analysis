# Bank-Analysis
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a bank dataset to identify default customers, detect potential fraud, and highlight valuable customers who benefit the bank. Using statistical and visualization techniques, the analysis provides insights into customer behavior to help the bank manage risks and improve decision-making.
